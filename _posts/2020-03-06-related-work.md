> (Mission-critical) Systems generallyhave failure rate requirements ranging from10−5to10−9failures per hour or other suitabletime period

>  Safety criticalsystems are systems whose failure can result in loss of life, significant property damage,or damage to the environment

> Leveson notes that almostall the identified software related accidents could be traced back to flaws in requirements specification rather than coding errors.
