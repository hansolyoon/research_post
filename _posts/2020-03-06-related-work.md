> (Mission-critical) Systems generally have failure rate requirements ranging from 10−5 to 10−9 failures per hour or other suitabletime period

>  Safety critical systems are systems whose failure can result in loss of life, significant property damage,or damage to the environment

> Leveson notes that almost all the identified software related accidents could be traced back to flaws in requirements specification rather than coding errors.

> Sotiropoulos et al. examine the ability of low-fidelity environmental simulations to reproduce bugs that were found during field tests of the same robot. Of the 33 bugs that occured during the filed test, only one could not be reproduced in the low-fidelity simulation.

> Although several navigation algorithms exist, some cannot be used in safety-critical scenarios because they have not been verifed

Collision avoidance for mobile robots with limited sensing and limited information about the environment.
