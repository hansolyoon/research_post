Collision Avoidance for Mobile Robots with Limited Sensing and Limited Information About the Environment

- One approach to prevent collisions is for the robot to repeatedly step or slow down (depending on the sensor range), rotate back and forth to sweep its sensors across the original blind spots, and then continue. However, it is inefficient.

### Questions
- passive safety

### Ideas
- To check if current state is able to guarantee future safety
- Instead of using sensors, can we detect object by observing trajectory? We can use mathematical approach like this paper to calculate the possible position of an obstacle.
