From Model Checking to Runtime Verification and Back

- This paper is about a novel approach for adapting an existing software model checker to perform precise runtime verification.

- The limitations of model checker: A model checker must, by design, fully isolate the program from any outside effects. Therefore, for verification purposes, the program under test is placed into an artificial environment, which gives non-deterministic responses to the program.

- If an environment model is too corase, errors may be missed, or spurious errors may be introduced. A detailed model is more costly, and the result is not guaranteed to exactly match the behavior of the actual environment.

- Extends an existing software model checker, DIVINE, with a runtime verification mode.
