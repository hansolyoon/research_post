Evaluating Perception Systems for AutonomousVehicles using Quality Temporal Logic

- Currently, there is no general framework for reasoning about the performance of perception systems. This paper introduces Timed Quality Temporal Logic (TQTL) as a formal language for monitoring and testing the performace of object detection and situation awareness algorithms for autonomous vehicles.

### Questions
- With TQTL, is it possible to detect property violations *in advance*? Like model checking, can it check violation before missions? Is it possible to use the concept of "predictive" monitoring?
- Just grading the performance of systems are meaningful? Why don't we check violation of the system? When it says TURN LEFT looking at STOP sign, we can conclude that it is wrong. Why we need this work of this paper?

---------
### Ideas
- Can we reason about the performance of perception systems? How do people reason about their image processing, perception systems?
- Is Souradeep's work for checking neural networks in real time? If not, can we do that?
- Can we use the concept of "quality checking" or "grading performance"?
- When the monitor flags false positive, we can use TQTL to grade/evaluate our monitor.
