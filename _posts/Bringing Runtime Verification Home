- RV for checking various specifications in a smart apartment.
	- behavioral correctness of the apartment sensors,
	- detection of specific user activities,
	- and composition of specification of the previous types.

- Standard RV techniques are not directly suitable to monitor the three classes of specifications. This is mainly due to scalability issues arising from the large number of sensors, as typically RV techniques rely on a single large formula to describe all behavior. This paper make use of RV with decentralized specification instead of using a large formula.
