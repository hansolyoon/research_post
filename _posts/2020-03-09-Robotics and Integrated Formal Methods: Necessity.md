Robotics and Integrated Formal Methods: Necessity meets Opportunity

- *integrated* formal methods.
- The techniques for developing and verifying each of system varieties are often quite distinct. This leads us to argue that diverse formal techniques must be integrated in order to develop, verify, and provide certification evidence for, robotic systems.

#### Formal Approaches to Robotic Challenges
- Challenge1: The verification of a robotic system's interaction with an unknown and dynamic environment.
- Challenge2: Ensuring that verification methods can provide suitable evidence either for certification or to gain public trust.

- There is currently no general framework integrating formal methods for robotic systems. One tool is integrated formal methods (iFM)

### Questions
- What is iFM?
- Still can't get the idea of necessity of iFM.
