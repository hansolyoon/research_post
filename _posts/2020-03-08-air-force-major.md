A fragmentary thought on my promotion to an Air Force Major

Finally, I have got promoted to an Air Force Major on Mar 1. It took 7 years after I became a Captain. I was hectic working on my research paper that had a deadline of Mar 1, so I was not aware of my promotion until one of my friends told me on Mar 2. 

I have no idea how many times I can promote in my military life but I think this may be my last promotion because I consider to retire before I can get promoted to Lt. Col. that requires another 7-9 years from now. Therefore, I had a special feeling when I heard I got promoted on Mar 1. 

Promotion, per se, is good; my salary increased by about $700 and the number of people who can bother me decreased (this is a big deal in a hierarchical system like the military). However, as I move up the ladder my responsibility increases and people expect that I am fully ready for it. Some of my friends said that is nothing, but I know they are not doing well in their work. When I asked if they enjoyed their job they said yes, but I knew their co-worker would say no if I asked them.

Anyway, for me, rank system is all about responsibility. With great power comes great responsibility although our power is not that great. That is why I had to take a lot of leardership classes and trainings to become a better leader. When I got promoted to a Major, I reminded of this thought and I felt scary. The last time I had this feeling was 7 years ago when I got promoted to Captain. Back then, I thought I was not ready to be a team leader and I looked the boy who was wearing father's jacket. Thanks to the help of all of my team members, I had not had any big problems and I learned a lot of things to be a better leader. 

But this time, I feel more nervous than 7 years ago. Captains and Majors are two main workers in the Air Force. Before Captain, officers have not enough experience, after Major, they are superviors who order tasks rather than do it by themselves. The reason I think I am not ready to be a Major is that my experience as a Captain was too short. In other words, I had not enough time not only to become a higher leader but also to experience various works in the military. Among 7 years, I have spent 1 year preparing to apply for graduate school and almost 3 years studying at the University. So, I was not in the military. 

I think Captain is a quite hard position in the Air Force. People in the military tend to think that Captains are professionals in their fields while 1st or 2nd lieutenants are considered to be "novices." In our field, where you worked and what you did during Captain determines whether you can go to nice positions in the future, that every one wants to go because the positions often guarantee next promotion. So Captain is pretty important period in military life.

But my period of Captain has gone and will never be back like everything in my life does. 


대위는 다시 돌아오지 않음

인생의 모든것이 그러함. 
중위, 소위도 안돌아옴
똑같이 사관생도 시절도 돌아오지 않음.

돌아오지 않는 것은 이렇게 짧은 단상과 함께 기억 한켠에 묻혀짐
그리고 부모님도 언젠가 그러할 것임

소령 진급에 부쳐 많은 지나간 것들에 대한 생각을 하게 되었고, 어느덧 부모님에까지 생각이 미침
