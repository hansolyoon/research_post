A fragmentary thought of my promotion to Air Force Major

Finally, I have got promoted to Air Force Major on Mar 1. I was hectic working on my research paper on that day, I was not aware of my promotion until one of my friends told me on Mar 2. 

I have no idea how many promotions exist in my military life, I had a special feeling about this promotion because of two reasons. First, it have passed 7 years, which I think it is long period, since I got promoted to Captain. I had to wait for 7 years to become a Major. Second, while I am studying in the US, my wife and I often discuss our future life in the US. In that case, this promotion should be my last promotion before I retire since it would be too late to wait for my next promotion. 

Anyway, no one knows his or her future so I would like to talk about the past. Like I mentioned above, I got promoted to Captain 7 years ago, in 2013. But my life as a Captain was short, technically, because for almost half of that period, I was in the US pursuing my MS and PhD degrees. Therefore, I have spent a pretty short time as a Captain.

I think Captain is a quite hard position in the Air Force. People in the military tend to think that Captains are professionals in their field while 1st or 2nd lieutenants are considered to be "novice." So we, officers, learn a lot of things for three years before getting promoted to Captain and want to show something when they become Captain. In our field, where you worked and what you did during Captain determines whether you can go to nice positions, where every one wants to go because the positions often guarantee their next promotion. So Captain is pretty important period in military life.

So, I feel often 아쉬움

3월 1일부로 진급
2013년에 진급해서 7년만에 진급
미국에서 2017년부터 살았으므로 4년 근무

4년밖에 안해본거에 대한 아쉬움
대위는 다시 돌아오지 않음

인생의 모든것이 그러함. 
중위, 소위도 안돌아옴
똑같이 사관생도 시절도 돌아오지 않음.

돌아오지 않는 것은 이렇게 짧은 단상과 함께 기억 한켠에 묻혀짐
그리고 부모님도 언젠가 그러할 것임

소령 진급에 부쳐 많은 지나간 것들에 대한 생각을 하게 되었고, 어느덧 부모님에까지 생각이 미침
