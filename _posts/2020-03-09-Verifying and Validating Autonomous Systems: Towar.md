Verifying and Validating Autonomous Systems: Towards an Integrated Approach

- When applying formal verification to a system that interacts with the real world we must use a *model* of the environment. This model represents an *abstraction* of the actual environment, but is necessarily incomplete and hence presents an issue for system verification.

- If the environment falls outside the abstraction captured by the model, then we cannot guarantee that the system is well-behaved.

- The idea of this paper consists in modeling the structured abstraction in a formalism that can be used both for statically verifying the autonomous system's behavior via model checking and for validating the model against the real environment by means of RV.

### Questions
- How to validate beyond verification?

---------
### Ideas
- How to mitigate problems that come from model mismatch?
- Can we use RV to check mismatch between UAV model and real behavior?
