Decision-Theoretic Monitoringof Cyber-Physical Systems

- Introduces a decision-theoretic view of runtime monitoring.
- Many CPS are stochastic and have states that are only partially observable. Runtime monitoring is an appealing alternative to the formal verification of such systems. 
- Formulate the monitoring problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and adopt a Partially Observable Monte-Carlo Planning (POMCP) to compute an approximate optimal policy of the monitoring POMDP.


---------
### Questions
- Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs): well-known formalism for describinig sequential decision processes for partially observable stochastic systems.
- Runtime monitor is different from just checking violation with simple lines of code? -> from Prof. Ha

---------
### Ideas
- Read carefully again to see how to use runtime monitor for a real system.
